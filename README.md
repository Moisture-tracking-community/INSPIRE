# Moisture_tracking_intercomparison

This repository contains scripts to analyse output from different moisture tracking models in the moisture tracking intercomparison project. This repository was initiated during a [Lorentz workshop during May 2024](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/moisture-tracking-intercomparison-time-to-address-the-uncertainty.html). The code is maintained by the participants of the project, which can be found in the citation.cff file (TO BE ADDED). You are free to use the code, given the license stated in .. (TO BE ADDED).
